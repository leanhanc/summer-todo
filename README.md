# Summer Todo

A test drive using Svelte-Kit and my first Svelte project overall.

## Live Demo

The project has been deployed to Vercel. You can [check it out](https://summer-todo.vercel.app/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```
